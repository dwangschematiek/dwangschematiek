					Here I have listed some things that I have going on right now that I also care to have floating out there on the web.
				</p>
				<h3>computers</h3>
				<p>
					Whenever I do computers, I do a lot of rust. This has been the case for a long time now, and I still really love it.
				</p><p>
					Over the past two weekends, I have worked on my terminal <code>xvg</code> graph viewer called <a href="https://github.com/koenwestendorp/phrace"><em>phrace</em></a>.
				</p><p>
					Another weekend project of mine is a slideshow program, that I have given the working title of <em>leif</em>. 
					It takes a file in my own markup language and turns them into slides.
					Font rendering in pixel fonts, image dithering, layout engine that drives me crazy.
					All the good stuff.
				</p><p>
					I've gotten very interested in going through the source code of some of the software I use in research.
					Especially the <a href="https://www.gromacs.org" target="_blannk">Gromacs</a> source seems interesting to me.
					Did I say I currently have a thing for molecular dynamics?
				</p><p>
					In fact, for the past summer I have hit my head on my desk from time to time in a number of disparate attempts at writing an <a href="https://manual.gromacs.org/2023.3/reference-manual/file-formats.html#xtc" target="_blank"><code>xtc</code> trajectory file format</a> reader.
					This is dumb and misguided, since I only work on the project when I am utterly tired, and the intricate bit compression scheme requires more concentration than I can realistically muster.
				</p><p>
					Whenever I <em><q>find myself</q></em> working on stuff like this, I post about my progress on <a href="/where#fedi">mastodon</a>.
					Sometimes I also <a href="/where#stream">stream</a> my work on these projects.
				</p>
				<h3>academics</h3>
				<p>
					Last summer, I got my BSc degree in Biology, with a major in Molecular Life Sciences.
					Currently I am working towards my Master's degree in Biomolecular Sciences.
				</p>
				<h3>weekends&mdash;the shape of the year</h3>
				<p>
					I have been very good in doing weekends, so far in this (academic) year. That is really cool and important.
