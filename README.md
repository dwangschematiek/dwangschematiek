Note: I have moved the source and deployment of this site.
To track its development, visit the [new home for its sources](https://git.sr.ht/~ma3ke/dwangschematiek).

The website is still up, of course. I have merely moved where it is hosted.
You can still find it at [dwangschematiek.nl](https://dwangschematiek.nl).
